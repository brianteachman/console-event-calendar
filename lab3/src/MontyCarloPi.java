 * lab3: Pi Approximation using the Monty Carlo Method
 *
 * The "Monte Carlo Method" is a method of solving problems using statistics.
 * Given the probability, P, that an event will occur in certain conditions,
 * a computer can be used to generate those conditions repeatedly. The number
 * of times the event occurs divided by the number of times the conditions
 * are generated should be approximately equal to Pi.
